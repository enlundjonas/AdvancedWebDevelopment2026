<h1>JavaScript introduction videos</h1>
Video 1/51
There is not much to say about this one, an introduction to the series and presentation of the ones behind it.
Video 2/51
JavaScript is the most used programming language globally. VSCode is written in JavaScript.
Video 3/51
JavaScript can run directly in the code using <script> (not recommended though) or in a .js file. Node.js for the server. 
Video 4/51
I will check out the extensions mentioned in the video (ESLint, Prettier and ES6 code snippets). I will also install Node.js 
Video 5/51
This was just more hands-on approach of the previous video, showing how to install everything mentioned. After watching this, I installed Node.js and some extensions on VSCode. I had some problems, but I managed to install it.
Video 6/51
Again faced some issues and confusion because of different terminals and environments. I learned about console log, substitutions and template literals, and found the syntax to be quite frustrating. 
Video 7/51
Code comments were familiar from both the C# and HTML context.  // and /* */ for single line and multi-line respectively. The shortcut he mentioned didn’t work for me, I need to look into that.
Video 8/51
More about comments, nothing new really. I still struggle with the shortcut, even after looking up keyboard shortcuts in vscode. It doesn't work for me for some reason.
Video 9/51
Declaring variables in three different ways: var, let, and const. When to use them and what defines them.
Video 10/51
Practicing declaring variables and see how they behave.
Video 11/51
Introducing string concatenation, combining two or more strings. Familiar stuff from the coding courses.
Video 12/51
Practical training with the subject from the previous video. Good reminder to be careful with numbers and strings!
Video 13/51
Repetition of template literals that were introduced in video 6. It’s gonna take some time to get used to the syntax for the placeholders.
Video 14/51
More hands-on approaches to template literals. Remember the backtick. You can do for example addition inside placeholders.
Video 15/51
Data types are more flexible than in C#. A lot of new things in this one, I might have to watch this a couple of times.
Video 16/51
Repetition of the previous video, and it made more sense when you see it and try it for yourself.
Video 17/51
Introduction to math in JS. 
 
Video 18/51
Continuing with math. Practicing the simple calculation methods, and some more advanced ones. The math object is good to know.
Video 19/51
Converting strings to integer. ParseInt() or parseFloat for strings to integer, and toString() the other way around. Also works with hexadeciamals, and returns NaN (not a number) if trying to convert something that is not numbers.
Video 20/51
Again, practicing what was talked about in the previous video. I learned that numbers after special characters are ignored when trying to convert to integers.
Video 21/51
Errors (try/catch/finally). Errors can be seen as what went wrong, exceptions as where and when something went wrong.
Video 22/51
More about errors and how to deal with them. I learned that finally is used to run code that will run no matter if a try/catch has handled an error or not.
Video 23/51
Dates and time. Some examples on how to handle dates in JS. You can use set methods to set specific years, months, seconds and so on. 
Video 24/51
Dates and time cont. Practicing the different ways to handle date and time. Remember that months start from 0!  
Video 25/51
Boolean logic and if statements. I learned the difference between == and ===. The first checks for equality no matter what data type, while the second checks for equal values and data types. Also applies to != and !==.
Video 26/51
Some new ways of writing if statements, ternary and without curly brackets. Practicing what we saw in video 25. 
Video 27/51
More Boolean logic. Some good to know things, such as strings are case sensitive. Shortcut operators (&& and ||) are new to me. 
Video 28/51
The switch statement is new to me. Very useful, and in general good to practice these things. 
Video 29/51
This video is about creating arrays, focusing on the theory on how to do it. I assume the next one will be showing how to do it practically. 
Video 30/51
I was correct. Here we practice different ways of creating arrays. Either with defined length or not.
Video 31/51
How to add and retrieve data to and from arrays. Familiar from the programming courses, but repetition never hurts. Remember we start at index 0!
Video 32/51
Practicing different ways of adding things to arrays, first when creating an array and later after the array is created. 
Video 33/51
More about arrays. This theory is not familiar to me, I don’t remember using push/pop and shift/unshift when working with arrays, and also not concat. 
Video 34/51
Practicing last videos topics. Initially I thought shift and unshift behaved in the opposite way than they actually did. Good practice. 
Video 35/51
In this video loops are introduced. These are well known from previous courses. For of loop is different from what I’m used to.
Video 36/51
Hands-on practice of the different loops. Not much to say about this one. 
Video 37/51
This video introduces functions. These also look familiar from coding courses. Functions have the function keyword, a name, and parameters. Also curly brackets and no semicolon.

Video 38/51
In this video we’re practicing function definition, invocation, naming, parameters, and return. 
Video 39/51
The topic is arrows and anonymous functions. Both of these are new to me. Arrow functions can be used to shorten the syntax for functions.
Video 40/51
Practicing things from the previous video. “Fat arrow” function doesn’t need the return keyword, and curly brackets are added only in multi-line function blocks.
Video 41/51
JSON introduction. I learned that JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. Data in JSONs are separated by commas, single objects are enclosed by curly brackets and arrays are enclosed by square brackets. We use stringify and parse to serialize and deserialize objects to and from JSONs.
Video 42/51
Practical examples of serialization and deserialization in JSONs. Very useful, I will need this in a project I’m working on. 
Video 43/51
Objects have properties, and are associated with methods. Creating objects in JS seems easier than what I remember from C#. Object properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation. Keep in mind the difference between accessing and invoking object methods.
Video 44/51
Objects continued. Objects can be created in different ways. They consist of name-value pairs. Dot notation and bracket notation give the same outcome. The this-keyword is explained and demonstrated.
Video 45/51
Introducing how to use promises for better performance and less waiting time. Newer versions of JS have built-in object for promise. 
Video 46/51
Demonstration of the Promise object. Promises have resolve and reject functions, as well as then() if the promise resolves or catch() if it rejects.
Video 47/51
This topic (async/await) relates to promises. It is used to make asynchronous code look more like synchronous. 
Video 48/51
Practical demonstration of async/await. Using async/await “pauses” the code from running. Await can only be used inside async, and it waits for a resolved promise before continuing.
Video 49/51
The topic is package management. Packages are reusable bundles of code and/or assets. Packages created by others can be used to save time on writing “boring” code.
Video 50/51
Package management continued. First we need install package.json via npm(Node Package Manager), in the terminal.  Installed packages can be run in the CLI, and with the help of packages we can for instance run scripts, connect to servers or format the code. 
Video 51/51
Now what? The video recommends the github repository that is linked under each video, and to keep using javascript in order to keep up the knowledge.
